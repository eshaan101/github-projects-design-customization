# Advanced GitHub Projects for Design Teams

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on customizing GitHub Projects for design workflows! This repository will guide you through creating and customizing a design project board using GitHub Projects V2.

## Step 4: Create Insights and Reports
The final step is to set up insights and reports to visualize and track your design progress.

### üìã Task: Create Project Insights
1. Navigate to your "Design Workflow" project
2. Click on the "Insights" tab
3. Click "New chart"
4. Create the following charts:
   - A bar chart showing the count of items by "Design Stage"
   - A chart showing the distribution of items by "Design Type"
   - A chart tracking progress over time (items moving through your workflow)
5. Save each chart
6. Arrange your charts on the dashboard

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 4" workflow to finish the tutorial.

### üìö The Value of Design Progress Insights
Insights and charts help design teams visualize their workload, track progress, and identify bottlenecks. They make it easier to report on design work to stakeholders and provide data to inform planning and resourcing decisions. Regular reporting helps design teams demonstrate their impact and value to the broader organization.

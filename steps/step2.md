## Step 2: Add Custom Views to Your Project
Now that you've created your project, let's set up multiple views to better manage your design workflow.

### üìã Task: Create Multiple Project Views
Create the following views in your "Design Workflow" project:
1. A "Kanban" board view with columns: "Ideation", "Design in Progress", "Ready for Review", "Approved"
2. A "Table" view called "All Designs"
3. A "Roadmap" view called "Design Timeline"

To create a new view:
- Click the dropdown menu next to the current view name (likely "Board")
- Select "New view"
- Choose the view type and give it a name
- Configure the columns/layout as described above

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 2" workflow to proceed to the next step.

### üìö What are Project Views?
Views allow you to look at your project data in different ways. A board view helps visualize workflow status, while table views show detailed information in rows and columns. Roadmap views help visualize work along a timeline. Having multiple views of the same data helps teams focus on what matters most for their specific needs.

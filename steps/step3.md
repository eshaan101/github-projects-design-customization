# Advanced GitHub Projects for Design Teams

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on customizing GitHub Projects for design workflows! This repository will guide you through creating and customizing a design project board using GitHub Projects V2.

## Step 3: Add Design-Specific Custom Fields
Now, let's make your design project more powerful by adding custom fields specifically helpful for design workflows.

### üìã Task: Add Custom Fields to Your Design Project
1. Navigate to your "Design Workflow" project
2. Go to your "Table" view (or any view)
3. Click the "+" button in the top right corner of the view
4. Select "New field"
5. Create the following fields:
   - "Design Stage" as a "Single select" with options: Concept, Wireframe, Mockup, Prototype, Final
   - "Design Type" as a "Single select" with options: UI, UX, Graphic, Illustration, Brand
   - "Feedback Round" as a "Number" field
   - "Stakeholders" as a "Text" field
   - "Due Date" as a "Date" field

6. Create a new filter in your Table view:
   - Click the "Filter" button in the top right
   - Create a filter to show only items where "Design Stage" is "Mockup" or "Prototype"

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 3" workflow to proceed to the next step.

### üìö Custom Fields for Design Work
Custom fields allow you to track information specific to design workflows. The fields we're adding help track what stage a design is in, what type of design it is, how many feedback rounds it has gone through, who the stakeholders are, and when it's due. These fields make it easier to sort, filter, and organize your design tasks effectively.
